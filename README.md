I think instead of having an entire page for the calculator, we can integrate the calculator into the profile page. The profile page should save all of the user's information, and show the calculator's results. I changed the calculator page's format to better accommodate this, but it is not done (need buttons to go back to the homepage, dashboard, and to logout. Also need to make everything look better and change the format some more). 
This is what the flow of the website should somewhat be like: When you first load up the website, you should be on the homepage. When you log in, you should be directed to the profile page to enter your information. After you enter your information and press save, it should calculate and display the information. After, you should be able to go to the dashboard (the main page) where you can do everything else such as - a way to log the food you have eaten that day, a way to get suggested meals, and a progress bar to see how much more you need to eat to reach your daily calorie goal.


If yall could, we need to brainstorm what information we will use to fill out our home page and make it look more professional and inviting. The home page should contain a large amount of fluff, an about us, and any other necessary additional information. 
Also, the theme is dark navy blue and white as of now. So just when yall tamper with the htmls keep that in mind. - Jonathan
