# Team-Repo
 Current tasks:
 1. Get pictures and change appeal of website
 2. Add a weekly log that shows the target calorie intake (gotten from calculator) for each day of the week and subtracts from it based on how many calories the user logs. (This action should not allow the user to change their actual target calore intake from the calculator but instead each instance of that number for their daily target).
